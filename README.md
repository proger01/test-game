## Main concepts

We are using:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started)

React components is used only for rendering HTML and dispatching actions.

Actions and Reducers is placed in **ducks** folder as described [here](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux).

We do not work with HTML DOM directly, only by using JSX.

We do not make API call inside components. Instead of this, we make an API call inside middleware.

We do not use local state inside components as long as we can.
Mostly preferred to use Stateless React components â€“ pure functions.
We use global state inside Redux Store to save and use application data.

We create Redux Container and connect it to Component if we need to use data from store or dispatch some actions.
Container for Component must have a name which is the same as component name with added suffix "Connected", for ex. App and AppConnected.
